# RAYCaster

## How to build
Prerequisites: `gcc` or `clang`, `python3`, `sdl2`  
Steps:  
  - Clone repository
  - `./make.py`

Resulting binary will reside in `target/release/bin/rayc`.  
To run it you will need a resource folder, which should contain a map file(s), textures and sprites.  
I will soon provide sample resource folder and a map editor.  

## Example
Here's an example which shows the engine running a recreation of Wolf3d's E1M1.
